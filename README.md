# ⚽ Football Match-Outcome Predictor (Elo + form ML)

A focused **machine-learning** project: predict the result of an international football
match (**Home win / Draw / Away win**) from two complementary signals: an **Elo rating**
(opponent-adjusted team strength) and each team's **recent goal form** (last 5 matches),
plus head-to-head, confederation and venue.

Why match-level and not "who wins the World Cup"? There have only been **22 World Cups → 22
champions**, far too few to learn from. Match prediction has many more labelled examples and
during a tournament you simply apply it match by match.

📖 **For the full methodology**: purpose, data, feature engineering, models, validation ->
see **[docs/PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md)**.

**Design rule:** logic lives in `src/`; notebooks/scripts import it. Only `src/load.py` reads `data/`.

## Setup

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Open `notebooks/match_model.ipynb` in VS Code, pick the `.venv` kernel, **Run All**. Or:

```python
from src import features, evaluate
table, _ = features.build_training_table()
print(evaluate.compare_models(table, "2021-01-01"))   # accuracy / log-loss / RPS per model
```

Analysis charts: `python scripts/feature_analysis.py` → `reports/*.png`.

## The model

**Features** (`src/features.py`): all known before kick-off, no leakage:

| Feature | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `elo_diff`, `home_elo`, `away_elo` | **Elo strength** (opponent-adjusted). the dominant feature |
| `home/away_goals_for_avg` | avg goals **scored**, last 5 matches (recent attacking form) |
| `home/away_goals_against_avg` | avg goals **conceded**, last 5 matches (recent defensive form) |
| `h2h_home_wins / draws / away_wins` | share of past meetings between the two teams |
| `home/away_confederation` | region code (UEFA, CONMEBOL, …) |
| `is_neutral` | neutral venue? |

**Models compared** (`src/model.py`): all 5 hyperparameter-tuned (`scripts/tune_models.py`):
`RandomForest`, `GradientBoosting`, `XGBoost`, `ExtraTrees`, `LogisticRegression`.
Single-label output is **draw-aware** (a plain argmax almost never predicts a draw).

**Validation** (`src/evaluate.py`): always a **time split** (train past, test future), averaged
walk-forward. Plus a `world_cup_backtest()` sanity check on the 2022 finals. Metrics:
**accuracy**, **log-loss**, **RPS**, calibration, permutation importance.
